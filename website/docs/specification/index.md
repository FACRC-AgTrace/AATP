<Disclaimer />

The specification is the heart of AATP.  It defines the detailed specifications for interoperable implementations. This page provides an outline of the purpose and scope of each component of the specification.

## Architecture

The architecture is the blueprint for all the components of the specification and how they work together. It defines the **design principles** which underpin the AATP and shows the components working together from the perspective of a **single actor** and across the **entire value-chain**. The AATP is a fundamentally **decentralised architecture** with no central store of data.
