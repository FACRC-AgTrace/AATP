## Overview

Web **vocabularies** are a means to bring consistent understanding of **meaning** to ESG claims and assessments throughout transparent value chains based on AATP. There are many ESG standards and regulations in Australia and around the world, each with multiple specific conformity **criteria**. This page provides guidance on the specific standards, regulations, and conformity criteria that may be referenced by product passports and conformity credentials issued by AATP implementers.
