## Digital Conformity Credentials

The AATP digital conformity credentials are all implemented as profiles of the [UNTP Digital Conformity Credential (DCC)](https://uncefact.github.io/spec-untp/docs/specification/ConformityCredential). An AATP DCC profile is no different in structure to a UNTP DCC but has specific constraints regarding the allowed conformity schemes, standards, and regulations. Implementers should familiarise with the UNTP DCC before implementing any of the AATP conformity credential profiles.

The table lists each AATP conformity credential type and version as well as it's UNTP version dependency.
