Use this checklist to orient yourself and track your progress through the AATP implementation process:

## Phase 1: Foundation and Planning

- [ ] Reviewed AATP architecture and understood how decentralized credentials work
- [ ] Identified target market segments (industry sectors, value chain roles, credential types)
- [ ] Assessed business value and validated business case
- [ ] Reviewed [UNTP Implementation Plans](https://spec-untp-fbb45f.opensource.unicc.org/docs/tools-and-support/ImplementationPlans#for-software-vendors) for additional context

## Phase 2: Technical Planning

- [ ] Reviewed technical specifications for relevant credential types
- [ ] Understood identity resolution mechanisms and credential discovery
- [ ] Planned credential lifecycle management (issuance, signing, storage, publishing, verification)

## Phase 3: Development

- [ ] Set up development environment with reference implementations and test data
- [ ] Implemented core credential support (at least one credential type)
- [ ] Implemented credential discovery and verification capabilities
- [ ] Integrated identity resolution support

## Phase 4: Testing and Validation

- [ ] Created trial credentials and validated structure/conformance
- [ ] Tested rendering, verification, and credential lifecycle
- [ ] Completed collaborative testing with partners and stakeholders
- [ ] Resolved all interoperability issues

## Phase 5: Registration and Go-to-Market

- [ ] Registered implementation on AATP Implementation Register
- [ ] Prepared customer enablement materials (documentation, training, support)
- [ ] Established processes for continuous improvement and specification updates

## Support Resources

- [ ] Joined [AATP Slack Channel](../guidance/Support.md#community-support) for community support
- [ ] Reviewed [Conformity Testing](../guidance/ConformityTesting.md) documentation
