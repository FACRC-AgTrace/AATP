title: Animal Feeding Event
---

The AATP Animal Feeding Event represents the feedlot process and records the association of a grain supply with an animal.  it uses the `association` event because the input and output animal identifier remains unchanged.  The feeding event simply connects an identified consignment of grain to the animal. When a specific consignment cannot be linked to a specific animal then feedlots should list all consignments that may have been fed to the animal.
