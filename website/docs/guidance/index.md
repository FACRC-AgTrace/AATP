## Implementation Steps

This section provides a simple AATP implementation pathway comprising a number of steps, each with an outcome and decision point for the next step.

| Step | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Outcome                                                                              |

| 1    | Review the [business case](../business-case/) section to confirm that AATP implementation is likely to deliver value for your organisation. Establish key performance measures to track costs and benefits.                                                                                                             | Positive business case                                                               |
| 2    | Review the guidance page relevant to your industry sector (eg [Livestock](/docs/livestock)) and role (eg [feedlot](/docs/livestock#implementation-guidance)) to determine which AATP credentials you should be issuing and publish your (non-binding) intent to implement so that you gain access to community support. | Implementation intent [registered](../register/)                                     |
| 3    | Choose a [software product](register/Software.md) or request your existing software system provider to implement AATP. Test your implementation using the [AATP test service](ConformityTesting). Use [support channels](Support.md) as needed.                                                                         | Update implementation [register](../register/) with positive test results            |
| 4    | Run a pilot with any other registered implementer(s) that has completed testing to confirm interoperability and value. Contact [support](Support.md) to facilitate coordination of pilot activities                                                                                                                     | Successful pilot                                                                     |
| 5    | Ramp up to full production volumes, routinely issuing and verifying AATP credentials. Measure cost and benefit performance indicators to track ongoing value                                                                                                                                                            | Consider publishing your story as an AATP [case study](../business-case/CaseStudies) |
