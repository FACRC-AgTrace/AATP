## Community Support

We encourage the development of a thriving open community around AATP implementation. Implementers may find that their support questions can answered by a community member.  

* Join the [AATP Slack Channel](https://join.slack.com/t/aatpworkspace/shared_invite/zt-2nyb02frq-IjQUy5MIOZQehSNDktScEA)


## AATP Helpdesk

For AATP implementers that have formally [registered their intent](../register) then the AATP help desk service is available to assist with implementation quesitons that are not answered by the community.

* Send and email to the AATP helpdesk via support@pyx.io


## Consulting Services

For organisations that require greater support to assist with their traceability and transparency programs, AATP consulting services can be engaged

* Send a request to agtrace@foodagility.com
