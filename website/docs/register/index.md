## Implementation Registers

AATP implementation registers are designed to track uptake of AATP. This provides value to the AATP governance group as a means to assess impact.  It also provides value to implementers as a means to raise awareness of implementation plans or to discover usable implementations.  There is a separate register for each implementer type.

* [Industry](Industry.md) will typically implement the DPP, DFR and DTE specifications so that the sustainability characteristics of their products and facilities are discoverable and verifiable. Registration provides a means to announce intent to participate in sustainable and interoperable value chains and allows buyers to discover suppliers with digitally verifiable sustainability data.
* [Software Solutions](Software.md) will typically implement the VCP and/or IDR specifications into their systems so that they can support their customers who will use the solutions to issue DPPs, DFRs, DTEs, and DCCs.  
* [Identity Registers](Registers.md) will typically implement the IDR specification (so that registered identities are resolvable) and the DIA specification (so that registered identities are verifiable).

## Implementation Status

Implementers may register a future intent to support AATP specifications. Once implementation is complete and tested, the implementation status will be updated accordingly.  

* Planned - means that the organisation is announcing a future intent to support UNTP by an approximate implementation date. Registration of intent does not imply a firm commitment and may be withdrawn. 
* Testing - means that an organisation is in-progress with implementation conformity testing.
* Active - means that the organisation has live implementations of one or more UNTP specifications.
* Deprecated - means that the organisation is supporting some UNTP implementations but is no longer actively sup;porting new implementations. 

## Implementation Scope

Each implementer organisation should provide a short statement about their AATP implementation plans and should define which of their products, solutions or services support which AATP specifications. 

Note that implementers need only declare intent to implement the minimum mandatory scope (defined on each specification page). Full details of actual implemented scope will be defined by the post implementation test report.

## Registration Process

To register your current or planned implementation please raise a [new issue](https://github.com/FACRC-AgTrace/AATP/issues) and select the "Implementation register template". 

* For registration of a future commitment to implement, the reviewers will confirm links and authority to represent the entity, then publish the registration.
* For registrations of actual implementations, the reviewers will request evidence of completion of interoperability tests.
