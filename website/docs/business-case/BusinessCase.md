The decision to implement AATP needs a positive business case to justify the investment. The purpose of this page is to provide a framework for business case development. We provide a generalised cost / benefit model and then discuss it's application to specific roles and industries. We also provide a separate cost benefit model and business case template for regulators.

## Industry Cost Benefit Model

The high level model shown below breaks benefits into three categories and costs into two categories.

* Benefits accrue through increasing revenue and/or decreasing cost. Improved margins that result from that of course contribute to corporate value but there are also less tangible benefits at the corporate level such as brand reputation. 
* Costs are incured through changes to production processes to acheive greater sustainability and the implementation of traceability & transparency systems to communicate that verifiable sustainabilty.


Actual benchmarks for benefits and costs by industry sector and goegraphic region will become increasingly available over time as AATP implementations progress.
