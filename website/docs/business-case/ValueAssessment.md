Once a community or individual implements AATP and transparency data starts to flow at scale, it will become important to continuously assess the actual value that is realised. Dashboards and scorecards that measure key performance indicators will energise ongoing action and provide valuable feedback at both community and national level. Therefore the AATP defines a minimal set of KPIs that each implementer can easily measure and report to their community - and which communities can report to national entities.
